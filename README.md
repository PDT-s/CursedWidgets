# CursedWidgets

## Overview

This project intends to be a library of `curses` widgets using Python. The aim is to provide complete implementations of the most common GUI widgets, such as menus, text fields or text boxes, so that they can be easily integrated in every app GUI that uses `curses`.

These widgets were initially implemented as part of an academic project, but because of their flexibility we decided to publish them apart as they can be easily reutilized in every other application.
